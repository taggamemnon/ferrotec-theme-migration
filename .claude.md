# Claude Code Instructions

## Project Context
This is a WordPress theme migration project. We are creating a new modern theme at `wp-content/themes/layers2025/` based on reference themes in `old-themes/`.

## Important Rules
1. **NEVER modify files in `old-themes/`** - These are reference only
2. **ALL new code goes in `wp-content/themes/layers2025/`**
3. The old themes are properly ignored via `.claudeignore`

## New Theme Location
```
wp-content/themes/layers2025/
```

## Reference Themes (Read-Only)
- `old-themes/layers2/` - Parent theme (Underscores-based)
- 5 child themes with product-specific customizations

## Development Approach
- Study reference themes to understand functionality
- Build new theme with modern WordPress standards
- Consolidate child theme features into unified architecture
- Test and validate before deployment
