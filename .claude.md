# Claude Code Instructions

## Session Startup Protocol
**IMPORTANT:** At the start of EVERY session:
1. Run `git fetch origin` to get latest changes
2. Check if current branch is behind main: `git status`
3. If behind, merge main: `git merge main` and resolve any conflicts
4. Then proceed with the requested task

This prevents working on outdated code when main has advanced.

## Project Context
This is a WordPress theme migration project. We are creating a new modern theme at `wp-content/themes/layers2025/` based on reference themes in `old-themes/`.

## Important Rules
1. **NEVER modify files in `old-themes/`** - These are reference only
2. **ALL new code goes in `wp-content/themes/layers2025/`**
3. The old themes are properly ignored via `.claudeignore`
4. **ALWAYS sync with main at session start** (see Session Startup Protocol above)

## New Theme Location
```
wp-content/themes/layers2025/
```

## Reference Themes (Read-Only)
- `old-themes/layers2/` - Parent theme (Underscores-based)
- 5 child themes with product-specific customizations

## Development Approach
- Study reference themes to understand functionality
- Build new theme with modern WordPress standards
- Consolidate child theme features into unified architecture
- Test and validate before deployment

## Additional Documentation
- See `README.md` for complete project overview
- See `claude.md` for detailed development instructions
- See `WORKFLOW.md` for git workflow and best practices
- See `FILE_ANALYSIS.md` for old theme file analysis
